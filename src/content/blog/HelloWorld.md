This is just an introductory post where I will explain a little bit more
what is this place and the purpose of it.

## What is this about?

The goal of this blog is to have my own space where I can write about anything
I'd like to share in the moment that could be useful for
someone else (And for my future self!).

It will be mainly focused in programming and software development,
but I don't want to constrain myself to just that
so let's see where all of this goes.

My main purpose is to enjoy the process, have fun while
writing posts and most important to feel comfortable with what I build.

## A few more notes

The color palette comes from the same theme I use in my Neovim setup.
It was developed by [craftzdog](https://www.craftz.dog/),
I am a big fan of his work. Go check out his [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/devaslife)!

The whole website was built using [Astro](https://astro.build/).
I've had great time with this framework,
it is definitely the right tool if you are looking to build a blog!

And that's it for today, I hope to be here soon with new content!

**Stay tuned!**
